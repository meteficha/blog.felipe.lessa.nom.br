Almost reminds me of what it can look like in C# for LINQ, though of course with the restriction in haskell with the keyword &#039;where&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Marek Sieradzki: Thanks for the feedback!  I&#039;m not a big fan of these operators as well, I&#039;ve opened an issue to track progress in this respect https://github.com/meteficha/esqueleto/issues/2.

It is possible to write TH code that translates an even more SQL-like language into esqueleto&#039;s operators.  However, I&#039;m not sure if that would be a good idea in practice, we&#039;d have to try it out.  Perhaps we could provide both interfaces as well.  I&#039;ve opened an issue on GitHub but don&#039;t hold your breath https://github.com/meteficha/esqueleto/issues/3 =).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very important that these operators are short and readable or whole thing is a quasiquote, if language is a very restricted EDSL then quasiquote is often a LOT more readable than EDSL that invents new &#039;==&#039;. I know it might sound like nitpicking but that&#039;s one of the reasons I didn&#039;t use HaskellDB.

Operators matter a lot. I don&#039;t know if we can just use some TH $macro that would process our normally written AST that has normal == and such. I think $tosql(... AST) would be more readable than code sprinkled with ^.

Other ones were that it didn&#039;t support pgsql stored procedures and that there was lots of code to write. Little was maintained, nothing was documented and I found -th package a lot later.]]></description>
